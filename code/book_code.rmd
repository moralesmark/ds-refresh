# Data wrangling with dplyr

We are going use "gapminder" data to learn `dplyr`. It's going to be amazing.

```{r first chunck}
x <- seq(1:15)

norm_x <- rnorm(5, 0.1)
```

# Chapter 5

## ggplot2

```{r ggplot2}
library(tidyverse)
data(mpg)
head(mpg)
mpg

# Assign plot to a variable
car_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# Draw the plot
car_plot +
geom_point()

#we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For instance, we can add transparency #(alpha) to avoid overplotting:
car_plot + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4)

###Or to color each species in the plot differently:
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point(aes(color = class))
```

```{r Exercise 5.5.1}

#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cty with different size points representing each car class and different colors for each fuel type.

#We get a warning here, because mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, size = class, color = fl))


```
